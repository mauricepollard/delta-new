                    <center> Founding History</center>
                    On Palm Sunday in April 1923, Gladys Merritt met with a young lady, who to this day is simply known
                    as Ms. X, and discussed the possibility of creating a sorority for teachers in Jersey City. This
                    discussion was different than other conversations the two had as this one resulted in invitations
                    being sent to eight other teachers to attend an information meeting. Ms. X attempted to discourage
                    Ms. Merritt from this venture thinking of how difficult and troublesome. Ms. Merritt promised should
                    there not be interest from those invited she would give up the idea. However those who attended that
                    information session were so motivated they voted to create a permanent organization that Friday
                    night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within a matter of weeks they had engaged an attorney to assist in establishing the sorority.
                    However being so young themselves, they needed to elect trustees to sign for them to become
                    incorporated. May 23, 1923, they were finally official and this date is still celebrated as our
                    offical Founder's Day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These truly outstanding women each went on to live up to the ideals they set forth as the mission of
                    the sorority. Each of them becoming educational leaders in their community having lasting impact
                    where they served so diligently. From those eight amazing young women meeting on a Friday evening
                    the sorority has grown to over 130 chapters internationally.
